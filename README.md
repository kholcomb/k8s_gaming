# K8sQuest
Learn Kubernetes by fixing it.

K8sQuest is a **local, game-based Kubernetes training platform** with an interactive GUI-like terminal interface. Each mission breaks something in Kubernetes. Your job is to fix it.

**50 progressive challenges across 5 worlds** - from beginner to advanced.

No cloud. No AWS. No costs.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring** - Watch Kubernetes resources update live with "check" command
- **Progressive Hints** - Unlocks gradually as you need help
- **Step-by-Step Guides** - Beginner-friendly walkthroughs when you need them
- **Post-Mission Debriefs** - Learn WHY your fix worked with real-world examples
- **Clear Mission Briefings** - Know difficulty, time estimate, and concepts
- **XP & Progress System** - Track your learning journey and achievements
- **Multi-Terminal Workflow** - Learn real-world debugging patterns
- **Auto-Save Progress** - Never lose your achievements
- **Reset Levels** - Get stuck? Clean slate anytime

## Safety First

K8sQuest includes **comprehensive safety guards** (enabled by default):
- Prevents deletion of critical namespaces (kube-system, default, etc.)
- Blocks destructive cluster-wide operations
- Limits operations to `k8squest` namespace via RBAC
- Confirms risky operations before execution
- Safe for beginners - hard to break things!

## Requirements
- Docker Desktop (running)
- kubectl
- kind
- bash
- python3

## Quick Start
```bash
# One-time setup
./install.sh

# Start playing (with visual diagrams)
./play.sh

# Or start in terminal-only mode
./play.sh --no-viz
```

## Visual Cluster Diagrams

K8sQuest now includes a **real-time web-based visualization** that shows your cluster architecture and highlights issues:

- **Auto-refreshes every 3 seconds** showing live cluster state
- **Level-specific diagrams** that match what you're learning
- **Color-coded health status** (green=healthy, orange=warning, red=error)
- **Interactive D3.js diagrams** with zoom and pan
- **Issue detection panel** showing what's broken and why

### Usage
```bash
# Default - visualizer auto-starts and opens in browser
./play.sh

# Disable for terminal-only experience (more realistic)
./play.sh --no-viz

# Use custom port
./play.sh --viz-port 9000
```

The visualizer runs on `http://localhost:8080` and provides a heads-up display for your cluster, making it easier to understand architecture and track your progress.

## How to Play

1. **Start the game** - Run `./play.sh` (keeps the game running)
2. **Read the mission briefing** - Understand what's broken
3. **OPEN A NEW TERMINAL** - Keep the game running in the first terminal
4. **Use kubectl to investigate** - Check pods, logs, and events in the NEW terminal
5. **Fix the issue** - Apply corrections using kubectl commands
6. **Return to game terminal** - Choose an action (check/validate/guide)
7. **Earn XP** - Complete missions to level up

## Available Commands During Play

- `check` - Monitor resource status in real-time (watch for changes!)
- `guide` - Show step-by-step solution walkthrough
- `hints` - Display progressive hints (unlocks more on each use)
- `solution` - View the solution.yaml file
- `validate` - Test if your solution works
- `skip` - Skip to the next level (no XP awarded)
- `quit` - Exit the game (progress is auto-saved)

## Post-Mission Debriefs

After completing each mission, you'll get a detailed debrief explaining:
- What actually happened and why
- The correct mental model for this concept
- Real-world production incident examples
- Interview questions you can now answer
- kubectl commands you mastered

**This is where the real learning happens.**

## Reset Levels

Get stuck or want to retry? Reset individual levels:
```bash
python3 engine/reset.py level-1-pods
python3 engine/reset.py level-2-deployments
```

Or reset everything:
```bash
python3 engine/reset.py all
```

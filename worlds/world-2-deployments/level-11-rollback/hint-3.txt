💡 Near-Solution Hint:

Rollback the deployment to the previous working version:

`kubectl rollout undo deployment/web-app -n k8squest`

This will:
1. Revert to the previous ReplicaSet
2. Scale down the broken pods
3. Scale up the working pods

Then verify:
`kubectl get deployment web-app -n k8squest`
`kubectl get pods -n k8squest`

All 3 pods should be Running!

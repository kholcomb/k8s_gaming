🧭 Direction Hint:

The deployment is stuck because the new image doesn't exist. Check:

`kubectl describe deployment web-app -n k8squest`

Look at the Events section. You'll see ImagePullBackOff errors.

Check the rollout history:
`kubectl rollout history deployment/web-app -n k8squest`

You can rollback to the previous version!

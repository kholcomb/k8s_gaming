💡 Near-Solution Hint:

Fix the rollout strategy to ensure zero downtime.

Steps:
1. Edit the deployment:
   `kubectl edit deployment critical-api -n k8squest`

2. Find the `strategy` section and change:

```yaml
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 1     # Only 1 pod down at a time
      maxSurge: 1           # Allow 1 extra pod during rollout
```

This ensures:
- With 3 replicas, at least 2 pods always running (3 - 1 = 2)
- Can create up to 4 pods during rollout (3 + 1 = 4)
- Zero downtime guaranteed!

3. Save and verify:
   `kubectl get deployment critical-api -n k8squest -o yaml | grep -A 5 strategy`

Try a rollout now - it should be smooth with no downtime!

🧭 Direction Hint:

The problem: `maxUnavailable: 100%` with `maxSurge: 0`

This means:
- maxUnavailable: 100% → Kubernetes can terminate ALL 3 pods at once (100% of 3 = 3)
- maxSurge: 0 → Kubernetes cannot create extra pods during rollout

Result: All old pods get terminated, then new pods start → COMPLETE DOWNTIME!

For zero-downtime deployments, you need:
- maxUnavailable < 100% (ensure some pods always running)
- OR maxSurge > 0 (allow extra pods during transition)

🔍 Observation Hint:

Check what resources exist:
`kubectl get deployments,replicasets -n k8squest`

Do you see a standalone ReplicaSet (web-app-rs) without a Deployment?

Try to update the image:
`kubectl set image replicaset/web-app-rs web=hashicorp/http-echo:latest -n k8squest`

Check the pods:
`kubectl get pods -n k8squest -l app=webapp`

Did the update work? Spoiler: It updated the ReplicaSet spec, but the EXISTING pods didn't change!

ReplicaSets don't do rolling updates - you'd have to manually delete pods or create a new ReplicaSet.

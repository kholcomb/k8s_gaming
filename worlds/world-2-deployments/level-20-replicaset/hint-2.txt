🧭 Direction Hint:

The problem: You have a standalone ReplicaSet.

ReplicaSets are a LOW-LEVEL resource that:
- Ensures desired number of pods are running
- Replaces crashed pods
- But does NOT handle updates gracefully

Deployments are a HIGH-LEVEL resource that:
- Creates and manages ReplicaSets for you
- Handles rolling updates automatically
- Provides rollback capability
- Tracks rollout history

Think of it like:
- ReplicaSet = "Keep 3 pods running" (simple)
- Deployment = "Manage versions, updates, rollbacks" (smart)

You should almost NEVER create ReplicaSets directly. Always use Deployments!

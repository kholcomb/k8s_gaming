💡 Near-Solution Hint:

In blue-green deployments, you switch traffic by updating the service selector.

Steps:
1. Edit the service:
   `kubectl edit service app-service -n k8squest`

2. Change the selector from blue to green:

```yaml
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp
    version: green  # Changed from blue to green
```

3. Save and exit.

4. Verify traffic is now going to green:
   `kubectl get endpoints app-service -n k8squest`
   
You should see 3 IPs from the green deployment now!

5. Test:
   `kubectl run -it --rm test --image=busybox --restart=Never -n k8squest -- wget -q -O- app-service`
   
Should show "Version GREEN (NEW)"!

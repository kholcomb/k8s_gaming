🧭 Direction Hint:

You have two deployments running:
- app-blue (old version)
- app-green (new version)

The service selector is:
```yaml
selector:
  app: myapp
  version: blue  # Problem!
```

This means the service only routes traffic to pods with BOTH labels:
- app=myapp ✅
- version=blue ✅ (matches app-blue pods)

The app-green pods have version=green, so they don't match!

Users are still seeing the OLD (blue) version.

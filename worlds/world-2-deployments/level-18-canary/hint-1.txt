🔍 Observation Hint:

Check the deployments:
`kubectl get deployments -n k8squest`

Look at the READY column. How many stable pods? How many canary pods?

Check the service endpoints:
`kubectl get endpoints app-service -n k8squest`

Count the IPs - this shows ALL pods receiving traffic (both stable and canary).

Test the traffic distribution:
`for i in {1..20}; do kubectl run -it --rm test-$i --image=busybox --restart=Never -n k8squest -- wget -q -O- app-service; done`

Count how many times you see "Stable" vs "Canary". Is it close to 50/50? That's wrong for a canary!

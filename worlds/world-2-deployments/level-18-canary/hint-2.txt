🧭 Direction Hint:

In canary deployments, you typically want:
- 90% traffic → Stable version
- 10% traffic → Canary version (new version being tested)

Currently, you have:
- app-stable: 5 replicas
- app-canary: 5 replicas
- Total: 10 pods

This gives 50/50 split (5/10 = 50%)!

For 10% canary with round numbers:
- Need 9 stable : 1 canary (9/10 = 90%, 1/10 = 10%)
- OR 18 stable : 2 canary
- OR 90 stable : 10 canary

The problem: Too many canary replicas!

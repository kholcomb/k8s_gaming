🧭 Direction Hint:

The PDB has `minAvailable: 3` but the deployment also has 3 replicas.

This means:
- minAvailable: 3 = "Must keep 3 pods available at all times"
- Replicas: 3 = "Only have 3 pods total"
- Result: Cannot evict ANY pod (3 - 0 < 3) ❌

This blocks:
- Node drains (kubectl drain)
- Cluster upgrades
- Autoscaler node removals
- Any voluntary disruptions

The PDB should allow at least 1 eviction!

🔍 Observation Hint:

Check the PodDisruptionBudget:
`kubectl get pdb -n k8squest`

Look at the ALLOWED column - is it 0?

Describe the PDB:
`kubectl describe pdb db-proxy-pdb -n k8squest`

Check "Disruptions allowed" - if it's 0, node drains will fail!

Check the deployment:
`kubectl get deployment database-proxy -n k8squest`

How many replicas? Compare to PDB's minAvailable.

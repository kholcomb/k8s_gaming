💡 Near-Solution Hint:

Fix the PDB to allow evictions while maintaining availability.

Steps:
1. Edit the PDB:
   `kubectl edit pdb db-proxy-pdb -n k8squest`

2. Change minAvailable from 3 to 2:

```yaml
spec:
  minAvailable: 2  # Keep 2 pods, allow 1 to be evicted
```

3. Save and verify:
   `kubectl get pdb db-proxy-pdb -n k8squest`

Now "ALLOWED" should be 1 instead of 0!

Alternative: Use maxUnavailable instead:
```yaml
spec:
  maxUnavailable: 1  # Allow 1 pod to be unavailable
```

Both achieve the same goal: allow 1 eviction, keep 2 running.

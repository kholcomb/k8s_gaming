💡 Near-Solution Hint:

You need to add a readiness probe that waits for the app to actually be ready.

Steps:
1. Edit the deployment:
   `kubectl edit deployment slow-startup-app -n k8squest`

2. Find the `livenessProbe` section, and add a `readinessProbe` right below it:

```yaml
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 22  # Wait for the 20s sleep + 2s buffer
          periodSeconds: 5
          successThreshold: 1
```

3. Save and exit. Pods will be recreated.

4. Watch the pods become ready:
   `kubectl get pods -n k8squest -l app=slow-app -w`

Now pods won't receive traffic until they're actually ready!

🧭 Direction Hint:

The problem: Pods are Running, but they take 20 seconds to actually be ready to serve traffic (simulated with sleep 20 in postStart hook).

Without a readiness probe, Kubernetes assumes "Running = Ready" and immediately adds the pod to the Service endpoints.

This means users hit pods that are still starting up → 502 Bad Gateway errors!

Check the deployment:
`kubectl get deployment slow-startup-app -n k8squest -o yaml | grep -A 10 readinessProbe`

You'll likely see nothing (or just livenessProbe). That's the problem!

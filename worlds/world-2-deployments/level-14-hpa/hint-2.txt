🧭 Direction Hint:

The error likely says: "unable to get metrics for resource cpu" or "the server could not find the requested resource (get services http:heapster:)"

This means Kubernetes can't get CPU/memory metrics because **metrics-server** is not installed!

Check if metrics-server exists:
`kubectl get deployment metrics-server -n kube-system`

If you get "NotFound", that's your problem. HPA needs metrics-server to function.

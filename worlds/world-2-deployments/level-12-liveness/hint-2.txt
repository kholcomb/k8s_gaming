🧭 Direction Hint:

The Events show "Liveness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 404"

This means the liveness probe is checking an endpoint that returns 404 (not found).

Check the deployment configuration:
`kubectl get deployment api-server -n k8squest -o yaml | grep -A 10 livenessProbe`

Look at the `path` being checked. Is that the correct health endpoint?

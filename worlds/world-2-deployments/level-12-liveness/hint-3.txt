💡 Near-Solution Hint:

The liveness probe is checking `/nonexistent-healthz` which doesn't exist (404 error).

The http-echo app responds on the root path `/`.

Steps to fix:
1. Edit the deployment:
   `kubectl edit deployment api-server -n k8squest`

2. Find the livenessProbe section and change:
   ```yaml
   path: /nonexistent-healthz
   ```
   to:
   ```yaml
   path: /
   ```

3. Save and exit. The deployment will automatically roll out fixed pods.

4. Wait 30 seconds and verify:
   `kubectl get pods -n k8squest -l app=api`
   
Pods should be Running with low restart counts!

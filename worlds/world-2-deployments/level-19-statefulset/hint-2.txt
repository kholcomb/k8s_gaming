🧭 Direction Hint:

The problem: You're using a Deployment for a database.

Deployments are designed for STATELESS apps (web servers, APIs) where:
- Any pod can be replaced
- Pods are interchangeable
- No stable identity needed

Databases are STATEFUL and need:
- Stable pod names (database-0, database-1)
- Stable network IDs (database-0.database-service)
- Persistent storage per pod
- Ordered startup (primary before replicas)
- Ordered shutdown (replicas before primary)

Solution: Use StatefulSet instead of Deployment!

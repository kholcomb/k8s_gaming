🔍 Observation Hint:

Check the current resource type:
`kubectl get deployments,statefulsets -n k8squest`

Is it a Deployment or StatefulSet?

Check the pod names:
`kubectl get pods -n k8squest -l app=database`

Deployment pods have random names like: database-7d8f9c-abc12
StatefulSet pods have stable names like: database-0, database-1, database-2

For stateful apps (databases, message queues), you need stable identities!

Try deleting a pod:
`kubectl delete pod <pod-name> -n k8squest`

Watch it recreate - does it get the same name?

💡 Near-Solution Hint:

The pod is requesting 999 CPUs and 999Gi of memory—way more than any node has!

Steps to fix:
1. Delete the pod: `kubectl delete pod hungry-app -n k8squest`
2. Edit broken.yaml and change the resource requests to reasonable values:
   - memory: "64Mi" (instead of 999Gi)
   - cpu: "100m" (instead of 999)
3. Apply: `kubectl apply -f broken.yaml`
4. Verify: `kubectl get pod hungry-app -n k8squest`

The pod should now be scheduled and running!

🧭 Direction Hint:

The Events show something like "0/1 nodes are available: 1 Insufficient cpu" or "Insufficient memory".

This means the pod is requesting more resources than any node in your cluster can provide.

Check what resources the pod is requesting:
`kubectl get pod hungry-app -n k8squest -o yaml | grep -A 4 resources:`

Compare this to available node capacity:
`kubectl describe nodes | grep -A 5 Allocatable`

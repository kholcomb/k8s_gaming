🧭 Direction Hint:

The container is listening on port 80, but the service is trying to forward traffic to port 8080.

The service has two port configurations:
- `port`: What clients connect to (external)
- `targetPort`: What port on the pod/container to forward to (internal)

The targetPort must match the containerPort!

💡 Near-Solution Hint:

The service selector has `app: frontend` but the pod has label `app: backend`. They don't match!

Steps to fix:
1. Delete the resources: `kubectl delete -f broken.yaml`
2. Edit broken.yaml and change the service selector from `app: frontend` to `app: backend`
3. Apply: `kubectl apply -f broken.yaml`
4. Verify endpoints exist: `kubectl get endpoints backend-service -n k8squest`

You should see an IP address listed as an endpoint!

💡 Near-Solution Hint:

Steps to fix:
1. Delete the pod: `kubectl delete pod database-app -n k8squest`
2. Edit broken.yaml and add the environment variable:
   ```yaml
   env:
   - name: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
     value: "mysecretpassword"
   ```
3. Apply: `kubectl apply -f broken.yaml`
4. Verify: `kubectl logs database-app -n k8squest`

You should see "database system is ready to accept connections"!

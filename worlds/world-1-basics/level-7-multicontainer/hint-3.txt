💡 Near-Solution Hint:

Steps to fix:
1. Delete the pod: `kubectl delete pod app-with-logging -n k8squest`
2. Edit broken.yaml and change the log-sidecar command to something that works:
   ```
   command: ["sh", "-c", "while true; do echo 'Logging...' >> /var/log/app.log; sleep 5; done"]
   ```
3. Apply: `kubectl apply -f broken.yaml`
4. Verify both containers running: `kubectl get pod app-with-logging -n k8squest`

You should see "2/2" in the READY column!

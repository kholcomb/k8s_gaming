🔍 Observation Hint:

Check the pod status: `kubectl get pod app-with-logging -n k8squest`

Look at the READY column. You should see something like "1/2" meaning only 1 of 2 containers is ready.

Run `kubectl describe pod app-with-logging -n k8squest` and look at the container statuses.
Which container is failing?

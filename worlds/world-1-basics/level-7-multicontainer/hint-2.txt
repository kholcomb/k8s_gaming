🧭 Direction Hint:

The "log-sidecar" container is crashing. To see why:

`kubectl logs app-with-logging -c log-sidecar -n k8squest`

The error shows that the file `/var/log/nonexistent.log` doesn't exist. The `tail -f` command fails immediately when the file is missing, causing the container to crash.

You need to fix the command to either:
1. Create the file first, or
2. Use a different command that doesn't require a pre-existing file

💡 Near-Solution Hint:

The image tag "nonexistent-tag-xyz-123" doesn't exist. You need to change it to a valid tag.

Steps to fix:
1. Delete the broken pod: `kubectl delete pod web-app -n k8squest`
2. Edit broken.yaml and change the image to: nginx:latest
3. Apply: `kubectl apply -f broken.yaml`
4. Verify: `kubectl get pod web-app -n k8squest`

🧭 Direction Hint:

The error shows "ImagePullBackOff" or "ErrImagePull". This means Kubernetes can't find the container image you specified.

Check the image name and tag in the pod specification. Does that image tag actually exist in Docker Hub?

Try: `kubectl get pod web-app -n k8squest -o yaml | grep image:`

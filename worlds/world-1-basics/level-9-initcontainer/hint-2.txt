🧭 Direction Hint:

The init container is trying to lookup "nonexistent-service" using `nslookup`, but that service doesn't exist. The container will loop forever waiting for it.

Init containers must complete successfully before the main container starts. This one never will!

You need to either:
1. Change the command to something that will complete, or
2. Create the service it's looking for

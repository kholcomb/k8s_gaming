💡 Near-Solution Hint:

Steps to fix:
1. Delete the pod: `kubectl delete pod web-with-init -n k8squest`
2. Edit broken.yaml and change the init container to do something useful:
   ```yaml
   command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo "Config ready" > /work-dir/config.txt']
   volumeMounts:
   - name: workdir
     mountPath: /work-dir
   ```
3. Add a volume to share data with the main container
4. Apply: `kubectl apply -f broken.yaml`

The init container will complete, and the main container will start!

🎯 HINT 2: Understanding emptyDir vs PVC

The problem is using ephemeral emptyDir for persistent data!

📚 Volume Type Comparison:

**emptyDir (Ephemeral):**
```yaml
volumes:
- name: data
  emptyDir: {}  # ❌ For persistent data!
```

Characteristics:
- Created when pod is assigned to node
- Initially empty
- **Deleted when pod is removed/restarted**
- Data lives only as long as the pod
- Fast, local storage

Use cases:
- Scratch space
- Temporary cache
- Data sharing between containers in same pod
- Build artifacts during pod lifetime

**PersistentVolumeClaim (Persistent):**
```yaml
volumes:
- name: data
  persistentVolumeClaim:
    claimName: app-data  # ✅ For persistent data!
```

Characteristics:
- Backed by PersistentVolume
- **Survives pod deletion/restart**
- Data persists independently of pod lifecycle
- Can be reattached to new pods
- May have performance overhead (network storage)

Use cases:
- Databases
- User uploads
- Application state
- Logs that must be retained
- Any data that must survive pod restarts

🔍 Your Situation:

App writes to `/data/persistent.txt`
→ Needs data to survive restarts
→ emptyDir is wrong choice!

💡 The Solution:
1. Create a PersistentVolumeClaim
2. Reference it in pod's volumes section

💡 Action: Replace emptyDir with persistentVolumeClaim!

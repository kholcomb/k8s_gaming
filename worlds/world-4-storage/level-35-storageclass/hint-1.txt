🔍 HINT 1: Observing the Problem

Let's investigate why the PVC is stuck in Pending:

1️⃣ Check PVC status:
   kubectl get pvc app-storage -n k8squest
   kubectl describe pvc app-storage -n k8squest
   
   What's the STATUS? Look at Events section!

2️⃣ Check what StorageClass the PVC wants:
   kubectl get pvc app-storage -n k8squest -o yaml | grep storageClassName
   
   What storage class is it requesting?

3️⃣ List available StorageClasses:
   kubectl get storageclass
   kubectl get sc
   
   Does the requested StorageClass exist?

4️⃣ Check pod status:
   kubectl get pod data-processor -n k8squest
   kubectl describe pod data-processor -n k8squest
   
   Can the pod start without its PVC?

📝 Key Observation:
The PVC references a StorageClass that doesn't exist in the cluster!

🤔 Questions:
• What is a StorageClass?
• How do you find available storage classes?
• Can you create a new StorageClass or use an existing one?

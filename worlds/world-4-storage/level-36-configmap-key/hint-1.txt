🔍 HINT 1: Observing the Problem

Let's find the missing ConfigMap key:

1️⃣ Check pod status:
   kubectl get pod web-app -n k8squest
   kubectl describe pod web-app -n k8squest
   
   Look at Events - what error do you see?

2️⃣ Check the ConfigMap:
   kubectl get configmap app-config -n k8squest
   kubectl describe configmap app-config -n k8squest
   
   What keys exist in the ConfigMap?

3️⃣ Check what the pod is trying to use:
   kubectl get pod web-app -n k8squest -o yaml | grep -A 5 "configMapKeyRef"
   
   What keys is the pod requesting?

4️⃣ Compare the two:
   - What keys exist in ConfigMap?
   - What keys does the pod need?
   - Which key is missing?

📝 Key Observation:
The pod references a ConfigMap key "database_host" that doesn't exist!

🤔 Questions:
• What keys are currently in the ConfigMap?
• What key is the pod looking for?
• How do you add a key to a ConfigMap?

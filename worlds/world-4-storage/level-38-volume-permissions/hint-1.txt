🔍 HINT 1: Observing the Problem

Let's investigate the permission denied error:

1️⃣ Check pod status:
   kubectl get pod writer-app -n k8squest
   kubectl logs writer-app -n k8squest
   
   What error message do you see?

2️⃣ Check the pod's security context:
   kubectl get pod writer-app -n k8squest -o yaml | grep -A 5 securityContext
   
   What user/group is the container running as?

3️⃣ Check the volume mount:
   kubectl exec writer-app -n k8squest -- ls -la /data 2>/dev/null || echo "Pod not running"
   
   If pod runs briefly, check what permissions the volume has

4️⃣ Look for fsGroup:
   kubectl get pod writer-app -n k8squest -o jsonpath='{.spec.securityContext.fsGroup}'
   
   Is fsGroup configured?

📝 Key Observation:
The container runs as user 1000, but the volume is owned by root (user 0)!

🤔 Questions:
• What is fsGroup?
• How do volume permissions work in Kubernetes?
• What's the difference between runAsUser and fsGroup?

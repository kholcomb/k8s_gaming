🎯 HINT 2: Understanding Volume Permissions

The problem is the volume ownership doesn't match the container user!

📚 How Volume Permissions Work:

**Default Behavior:**
- Volumes are owned by root (user 0, group 0)
- Container runs as user 1000
- User 1000 can't write to root-owned directory!

**Container Security Context:**
```yaml
containers:
- securityContext:
    runAsUser: 1000    # Container runs as this user
    runAsGroup: 1000   # Container runs as this group
```

**Pod Security Context with fsGroup:**
```yaml
spec:
  securityContext:
    fsGroup: 1000  # ✅ Changes volume ownership to group 1000!
```

🔍 How fsGroup Works:

1. Volume is mounted
2. Kubernetes changes ownership: `chown -R :1000 /volume`
3. Volume group = 1000
4. User 1000 (in group 1000) can now write!

**Without fsGroup:**
```bash
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 /data  # User 1000 can't write
```

**With fsGroup: 1000:**
```bash
drwxrwsr-x  2 root 1000  4096 /data  # Group 1000 can write!
```

💡 The Solution:
Add fsGroup to pod's securityContext:
```yaml
spec:
  securityContext:
    fsGroup: 1000  # Match runAsGroup
```

💡 Action: Set fsGroup in the pod spec's securityContext!

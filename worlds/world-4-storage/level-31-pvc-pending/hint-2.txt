🎯 HINT 2: Understanding PV and PVC Binding

The problem is that the PersistentVolume doesn't match the PersistentVolumeClaim requirements!

📚 How PV/PVC Binding Works:

**PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC):**
• A request for storage by a pod
• Specifies: size, storage class, access mode
• Status: Pending → Bound
• Like ordering a specific pizza

**PersistentVolume (PV):**
• Actual storage provisioned in the cluster
• Provides: capacity, storage class, access mode
• Status: Available → Bound → Released
• Like the pizza that gets delivered

**Binding Process:**
1. PVC requests storage with specific requirements
2. Kubernetes looks for available PV that matches ALL requirements:
   ✓ Storage capacity (PV >= PVC request)
   ✓ StorageClass name matches exactly
   ✓ Access mode compatible
3. If match found: PVC binds to PV (both become "Bound")
4. If no match: PVC stays "Pending" forever

🔍 Current Situation:

Check the PVC requirements:
```bash
kubectl get pvc app-storage-claim -n k8squest -o yaml
```

Look for:
```yaml
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: fast      # ← PVC needs "fast" class
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi            # ← PVC needs 5Gi
```

Check the PV specifications:
```bash
kubectl get pv app-storage -o yaml
```

Look for:
```yaml
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi              # ← PV only has 1Gi!
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: standard  # ← PV has "standard" class!
```

🚨 Mismatches Found:
1. **Storage capacity**: PVC needs 5Gi, PV only has 1Gi (too small!)
2. **StorageClass**: PVC wants "fast", PV has "standard" (doesn't match!)

💡 The Solution:
You need to update the PV to match the PVC requirements:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: app-storage
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi             # ✅ Match PVC request
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: fast     # ✅ Match PVC storage class
  # ... rest of config
```

📊 Binding Requirements Checklist:

For PVC to bind to PV, ALL must match:
- [ ] Storage Capacity: PV capacity >= PVC request
- [ ] StorageClass: PV class == PVC class (exact match)
- [ ] Access Mode: PV supports at least one of PVC's modes
- [ ] PV Status: Available (not already bound)

🎯 Action Items:
1. Delete the existing PV (or update if possible)
2. Create new PV with matching specifications
3. Verify PVC binds automatically
4. Check pod starts successfully

Access Modes Explained:
• **ReadWriteOnce (RWO)**: One pod can read/write
• **ReadOnlyMany (ROX)**: Many pods can read
• **ReadWriteMany (RWX)**: Many pods can read/write

🔍 HINT 1: Observing the Problem

Let's investigate why the PVC is stuck in Pending:

1️⃣ Check the PVC status:
   kubectl get pvc -n k8squest
   
   Notice the STATUS column - what does it show?

2️⃣ Get more details about the PVC:
   kubectl describe pvc app-storage-claim -n k8squest
   
   Look for:
   • Status: Pending
   • Events: Any error messages
   • Requested storage and storage class

3️⃣ Check if any PersistentVolumes exist:
   kubectl get pv
   
   Do you see a PV that could satisfy the PVC?

4️⃣ Check the pod status:
   kubectl get pod database-pod -n k8squest
   
   What state is it in? Can you see why?

5️⃣ Describe the pod to see events:
   kubectl describe pod database-pod -n k8squest
   
   Look for messages about volume mounting issues

📝 Key Observations:
   • PVC is Pending (not Bound)
   • Pod is ContainerCreating (waiting for volume)
   • Pod can't start until PVC is bound
   • PVC can't bind without a matching PV

🤔 Questions to Consider:
   • What is the PVC requesting (storage size, class, access mode)?
   • Does a PV exist that matches these requirements?
   • What happens if PV and PVC requirements don't match?

The PVC and PV specifications need to match perfectly for binding to occur!

description: |
  Your application pod is stuck in ContainerCreating state because its PersistentVolumeClaim 
  is in Pending status. The pod needs persistent storage to save database files, but the 
  storage isn't being provisioned. You need to investigate why the PVC can't bind to a 
  PersistentVolume and fix the storage configuration.

learning_objectives:
  - Understand PersistentVolume (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) relationship
  - Learn how PVC binding works in Kubernetes
  - Configure PV to match PVC requirements
  - Understand storage capacity and access modes

concepts:
  - persistentvolume
  - persistentvolumeclaim
  - pvc-binding
  - storage-capacity
  - access-modes
  - volume-provisioning

success_criteria:
  - PVC successfully bound to a PV
  - PVC status changes from Pending to Bound
  - Pod successfully starts and mounts the volume

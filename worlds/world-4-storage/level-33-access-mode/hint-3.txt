✅ HINT 3: Complete Solution

Fix: Change accessModes from ReadWriteOnce to ReadWriteMany

📝 In PersistentVolume:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: shared-storage
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany  # ✅ Changed from ReadWriteOnce
```

📝 In PersistentVolumeClaim:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: shared-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany  # ✅ Changed from ReadWriteOnce
```

🚀 Apply:
```bash
kubectl delete -f broken.yaml
kubectl apply -f solution.yaml
kubectl get pods -n k8squest -l app=web -w
# Watch all 3 pods start successfully
```

💡 Remember: Both PV and PVC must have matching access modes!

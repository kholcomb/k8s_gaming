🎯 HINT 2: Understanding Access Modes

The problem is the access mode restricts how many pods can use the storage!

📚 Access Modes Explained:

**ReadWriteOnce (RWO)**
- Volume can be mounted by ONE node only
- Multiple pods on SAME node can share it
- Most common mode, works with most storage types
```yaml
accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce  # ❌ Not for multi-node deployments
```

**ReadWriteMany (RWX)**
- Volume can be mounted by MULTIPLE nodes
- All pods can share it simultaneously
- Requires network storage (NFS, CephFS, etc.)
```yaml
accessModes:
  - ReadWriteMany  # ✅ Perfect for shared content
```

**ReadOnlyMany (ROX)**
- Multiple nodes can mount, but read-only
- Good for static content distribution

🔍 Your Situation:

Deployment has 3 replicas:
- Kubernetes schedules them across different nodes
- PVC has ReadWriteOnce
- Only first pod can mount the volume
- Other pods stuck: "Volume already in use"

💡 The Solution:
Change to ReadWriteMany in BOTH PV and PVC!

🔍 HINT 1: Observing the Problem

Let's investigate the StatefulSet storage issue:

1️⃣ Check the StatefulSet:
   kubectl get statefulset postgres-cluster -n k8squest
   kubectl describe statefulset postgres-cluster -n k8squest
   
   How many replicas are there?

2️⃣ Check the pods:
   kubectl get pods -n k8squest -l app=postgres
   
   Are all pods running?

3️⃣ Check PVCs:
   kubectl get pvc -n k8squest
   
   How many PVCs exist? One or multiple?

4️⃣ Look at the StatefulSet spec:
   kubectl get statefulset postgres-cluster -n k8squest -o yaml | grep -A 10 volumes
   
   Is volumeClaimTemplates defined?

📝 Key Observation:
All pods are trying to share a SINGLE PVC instead of each having their own!

🤔 Questions:
• Should database pods share the same storage?
• What is volumeClaimTemplates?
• How does StatefulSet provide per-pod storage?

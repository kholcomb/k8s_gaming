🎯 HINT 2: Understanding Reclaim Policies

The problem is using "Delete" policy for important data!

📚 Reclaim Policy Options:

**Delete (Dangerous for Production):**
```yaml
spec:
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Delete  # ❌ Data loss risk!
```

What happens when PVC deleted:
1. PVC is removed
2. PV is automatically deleted
3. **All data is permanently lost!**
4. Cannot recover data

**Retain (Safe for Production):**
```yaml
spec:
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain  # ✅ Data preserved!
```

What happens when PVC deleted:
1. PVC is removed
2. PV status changes to "Released"
3. **Data remains on disk intact**
4. Admin can recover or clean up manually
5. PV cannot be auto-rebound (requires manual reclaim)

**Recycle (Deprecated):**
- Runs `rm -rf` on volume
- Not recommended, use Delete or Retain

🔍 When to Use Each:

**Use Delete:**
- Development/testing environments
- Temporary data
- Cloud storage with automatic backups
- Cost savings (auto-cleanup)

**Use Retain:**
- Production databases
- Critical application data
- Compliance requirements
- When manual review needed before deletion

💡 The Solution:
Change reclaim policy to Retain for important data!

💡 Action: Set persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy to "Retain" in the PV spec!

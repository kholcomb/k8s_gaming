🔍 HINT 1: Observing the Problem

Let's understand the reclaim policy issue:

1️⃣ Check the PersistentVolume:
   kubectl get pv
   kubectl describe pv important-data
   
   What is the RECLAIM POLICY?

2️⃣ Check the PVC:
   kubectl get pvc data-claim -n k8squest
   
   Is it Bound to the PV?

3️⃣ Look at what happens with different policies:
   kubectl get pv important-data -o jsonpath='{.spec.persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy}'
   
   Is it "Delete" or "Retain"?

4️⃣ Understand the risk:
   • Delete policy: PV and data deleted when PVC removed
   • Retain policy: PV released but data kept (manual cleanup)

📝 Key Observation:
The PV has "Delete" policy, which will WIPE ALL DATA when the PVC is deleted!

🤔 Questions:
• What happens to data with "Delete" policy?
• What happens with "Retain" policy?
• Which is safer for production data?
• How do you change the reclaim policy?

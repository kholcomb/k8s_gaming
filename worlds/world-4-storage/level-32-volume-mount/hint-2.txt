🎯 HINT 2: Understanding Volume Mounts

The problem is the mountPath doesn't match where the app expects files!

📚 How Volume Mounting Works:

**volumes:** Defines WHAT storage to use
```yaml
volumes:
- name: config-volume      # Give it a name
  persistentVolumeClaim:
    claimName: config-pvc  # Reference PVC
```

**volumeMounts:** Defines WHERE to mount it
```yaml
volumeMounts:
- name: config-volume      # Must match volume name
  mountPath: /app/config   # Path inside container
```

🔍 Current Situation:

App expects config at:
```
/app/config/app.conf
```

But volume is mounted at:
```yaml
volumeMounts:
- name: config-volume
  mountPath: /data  # ❌ Wrong path!
```

So config file is actually at:
```
/data/app.conf  # App can't find it here!
```

💡 The Solution:
Change mountPath to match app's expectation:
```yaml
volumeMounts:
- name: config-volume
  mountPath: /app/config  # ✅ Matches app's path
```

🎯 Action: Update the mountPath in BOTH init container and main container!

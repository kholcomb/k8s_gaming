🔍 HINT 1: Observing the Problem

Let's investigate why the pod is failing:

1️⃣ Check pod status:
   kubectl get pod web-app -n k8squest
   
   What's the STATUS? Is it Running or CrashLoopBackOff?

2️⃣ Check pod logs:
   kubectl logs web-app -n k8squest
   
   What error message do you see?

3️⃣ Check the pod specification:
   kubectl get pod web-app -n k8squest -o yaml | grep -A 5 volumeMounts
   
   Where is the volume mounted?

4️⃣ Look at the application's expectations:
   The app tries to read: /app/config/app.conf
   Where is the volume currently mounted?

📝 Key Observation:
The application expects files at one path, but the volume is mounted at a different path!

🤔 Questions:
• What does mountPath specify?
• Can you change where a volume is mounted?
• Do init containers and main containers need the same mount path?

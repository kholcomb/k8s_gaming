  🚨 PRODUCTION EMERGENCY! Multiple simultaneous failures! 🚨
  
  The production cluster is experiencing a cascade of issues:
  
  1. 🔐 RBAC: App can't access Kubernetes API (Permission denied)
  2. 🛡️  SecurityContext: Running as root, violating security policy
  3. 💰 ResourceQuota: Exceeding namespace CPU quota
  4. 🔒 NetworkPolicy: Database unreachable, network blocked
  5. 📍 Node Affinity: Can't schedule on required node pool
  6. ⚡ Taints: Nodes tainted, pods have no tolerations
  7. 🛡️  PDB: Blocking necessary maintenance
  8. 🔐 Pod Security: Violating restricted standard
  9. ⭐ Priority: Critical pods stuck behind low-priority workloads
  
  Your mission: Fix ALL issues simultaneously. This is the ultimate test!

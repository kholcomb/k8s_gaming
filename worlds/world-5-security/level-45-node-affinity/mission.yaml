description: |
  Your GPU workload won't schedule! The pod is stuck in Pending state.
  
  The pod has a nodeAffinity requirement for GPU nodes, but the affinity
  rule doesn't match any nodes in the cluster.
  
  Error: "0/3 nodes are available: 3 node(s) didn't match Pod's node affinity"
  
  Your mission: Fix the nodeAffinity selector to match actual node labels.

learning_objectives:
  - Understand required vs preferred affinity
  - Configure nodeAffinity selectors correctly
  - Match node label keys and values
  - Debug scheduling failures

# 💡 HINT 1: Observation

## Check Pod Status

```bash
kubectl get pod gpu-workload -n k8squest
```

You'll see it's **Pending**.

## Check Pod Events

```bash
kubectl describe pod gpu-workload -n k8squest
```

Look for the error:
```
Events:
  Warning  FailedScheduling  ... 0/3 nodes are available: 
  3 node(s) didn't match Pod's node affinity/selector
```

## Check Node Labels

```bash
kubectl get nodes --show-labels
```

Look at what labels your nodes actually have.

## Check Pod's NodeAffinity

```bash
kubectl get pod gpu-workload -n k8squest -o yaml | grep -A 10 nodeAffinity
```

Compare the affinity requirements with actual node labels.

## The Problem

The pod requires:
```yaml
- key: gpu-type
  values: [nvidia-tesla]
```

But nodes don't have this label!

## The Fix

1. Check what labels nodes actually have
2. Update nodeAffinity to match OR label nodes appropriately
3. Re-apply the pod

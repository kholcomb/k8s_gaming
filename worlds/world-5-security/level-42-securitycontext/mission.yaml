description: |
  Your security scanner detected a critical vulnerability: containers running as root!
  
  A web application is deployed, but the security policy requires:
  1. Container must run as non-root user
  2. Privilege escalation must be disabled
  
  The pod keeps crashing with "container has runAsNonRoot and image will run as root"
  
  Your mission: Configure SecurityContext to run containers securely as non-root.

learning_objectives:
  - Understand container user contexts
  - Configure runAsNonRoot and runAsUser
  - Prevent privilege escalation
  - Apply security best practices

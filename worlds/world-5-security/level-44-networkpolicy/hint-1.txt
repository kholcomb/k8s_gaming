# 💡 HINT 1: Observation and Analysis

Start by understanding the network connectivity problem:

## Step 1: Check Pod Status

```bash
kubectl get pods -n k8squest
```

Both pods should be Running.

## Step 2: Check Backend Pod Logs

```bash
kubectl logs backend -n k8squest
```

You'll see connection failures:
```
nc: database (5432): Connection refused
nc: database (5432): Connection timed out
```

## Step 3: Examine NetworkPolicies

```bash
kubectl get networkpolicy -n k8squest
```

You should see a policy named `deny-all`.

```bash
kubectl describe networkpolicy deny-all -n k8squest
```

Look at the output:
```yaml
Spec:
  PodSelector:     <none>  # Applies to ALL pods
  Allowing ingress traffic: <none>  # ❌ Blocks all incoming
  Allowing egress traffic: <none>   # ❌ Blocks all outgoing
```

## Understanding the Problem

**Default Kubernetes behavior:**
- Without NetworkPolicy: All traffic allowed (open)

**With empty NetworkPolicy:**
```yaml
spec:
  podSelector: {}  # All pods
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  # No rules = DENY ALL
```

**Result:**
- Backend can't send traffic to database (egress blocked)
- Database can't receive traffic (ingress blocked)
- Even DNS doesn't work!

## What You Need to Fix

You need TWO NetworkPolicies:

1. **Database Ingress:** Allow incoming connections from backend
2. **Backend Egress:** Allow outgoing connections to database (+ DNS)

## Testing Network Connectivity

```bash
# Test from backend to database
kubectl exec backend -n k8squest -- nc -vz database 5432

# Should succeed after fix
```

# 💡 HINTS: PriorityClass

## Problem
Critical pods can't preempt dev pods - all have same priority.

## Solution
1. Create PriorityClasses with different values
2. Assign high-priority to critical pods
3. Scheduler will preempt lower priority when needed

```yaml
apiVersion: scheduling.k8s.io/v1
kind: PriorityClass
metadata:
  name: high-priority
value: 1000  # Higher = more important
preemptionPolicy: PreemptLowerPriority
```

Assign to pod:
```yaml
spec:
  priorityClassName: high-priority
```

Run `./validate.sh` to verify!

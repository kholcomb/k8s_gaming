# 💡 HINT 1: Observation and Analysis

Start by understanding the quota situation:

## Step 1: Check Pod Status

```bash
kubectl get pod resource-hungry-app -n k8squest
```

You'll likely see status **Pending** instead of Running.

## Step 2: Examine Pod Events

```bash
kubectl describe pod resource-hungry-app -n k8squest
```

Look at the **Events** section. You should see:
```
Warning  FailedScheduling  ... exceeded quota: compute-quota, requested: requests.cpu=2500m
```

This tells you the pod is trying to request more resources than the quota allows!

## Step 3: Check the ResourceQuota

```bash
kubectl describe resourcequota compute-quota -n k8squest
```

You'll see something like:
```
Resource         Used  Hard
--------         ----  ----
limits.cpu       0     4
limits.memory    0     4Gi
pods             0     10
requests.cpu     0     2        ← Only 2 CPUs available!
requests.memory  0     2Gi
```

## Step 4: Check Pod's Resource Requests

```bash
kubectl get pod resource-hungry-app -n k8squest -o yaml | grep -A 4 requests
```

You'll see:
```yaml
requests:
  cpu: "2500m"  # ← Requesting 2.5 CPUs!
  memory: "1Gi"
```

## Understanding the Problem

**The Math:**
- Namespace quota allows: **2 CPUs total**
- Pod is requesting: **2.5 CPUs** (2500 millicores)
- 2.5 > 2 → **Quota exceeded!**

**Why quotas exist:**
- Prevent resource hogging
- Fair share across teams
- Protect cluster stability
- Cost control

## What You Need to Fix

Option 1: **Reduce pod's resource requests** to fit within quota
Option 2: **Increase quota** if justified (usually not your call)

For this challenge: **Reduce the pod's resource requests**

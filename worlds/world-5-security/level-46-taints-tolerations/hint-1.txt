# 💡 HINT 1: Observing the Problem

## Check Pod Status
```bash
kubectl get pod regular-app -n k8squest
```
Status: **Pending**

## Check Events
```bash
kubectl describe pod regular-app -n k8squest
```
Error: `node(s) had untolerated taint {dedicated: gpu}`

## Check Node Taints
```bash
kubectl describe node kind-control-plane | grep Taints
```
You'll see: `Taints: dedicated=gpu:NoSchedule`

## The Problem
- Node has taint: `dedicated=gpu:NoSchedule`
- Pod needs matching toleration
- Without toleration, pod can't schedule

## The Fix
Add toleration to pod spec matching the taint.

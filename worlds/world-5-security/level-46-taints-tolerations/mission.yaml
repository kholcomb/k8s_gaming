  - taints
  - tolerations

  - noexecute
description: |
  Your application pods won't schedule! Nodes are tainted for dedicated workloads.
  
  All nodes have a taint "dedicated=gpu:NoSchedule" to reserve them for GPU workloads.
  Your regular application doesn't have the matching toleration.
  
  Error: "0/3 nodes are available: 3 node(s) had untolerated taint"
  
  Your mission: Add tolerations to allow scheduling on tainted nodes.

learning_objectives:
  - Understand taints and tolerations
  - Configure tolerations correctly
  - Differentiate NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule, NoExecute
  - Debug taint-related scheduling failures

# 💡 HINT 2: Taints & Tolerations

## What Are Taints?

Taints repel pods from nodes (unless pods tolerate the taint).

```bash
kubectl taint nodes <node> key=value:Effect
```

## Taint Effects

- **NoSchedule**: Don't schedule new pods
- **PreferNoSchedule**: Try not to schedule (soft)
- **NoExecute**: Don't schedule + evict existing pods

## What Are Tolerations?

Tolerations allow pods to schedule on tainted nodes.

```yaml
tolerations:
- key: "dedicated"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "gpu"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
```

## Your Situation

**Node taint:**
```
dedicated=gpu:NoSchedule
```

**Pod needs:**
```yaml
tolerations:
- key: "dedicated"  # Match key
  value: "gpu"  # Match value  
  effect: "NoSchedule"  # Match effect
  operator: "Equal"  # Exact match
```

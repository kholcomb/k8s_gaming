# Problem: Nodes are tainted but pod has no matching toleration
# Result: Pod stuck Pending - can't schedule on any node

# Setup: Taint the node (simulating dedicated GPU nodes)
# kubectl taint nodes kind-control-plane dedicated=gpu:NoSchedule

  # ❌ No tolerations!
  # Pod can't schedule on tainted nodes
  
# Node has taint: dedicated=gpu:NoSchedule
# Pod needs toleration to match, but doesn't have it

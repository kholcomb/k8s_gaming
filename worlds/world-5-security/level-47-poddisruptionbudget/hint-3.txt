# 💡 HINT 3: Solution

## Fix: Scale Deployment + Adjust PDB

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3  # ✅ Increased from 2

---
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
spec:
  minAvailable: 2  # ✅ Reduced from 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web
```

Now: 3 replicas, need 2 minimum = ✅ Can lose 1 during drain

## Apply
```bash
kubectl apply -f solution.yaml
./validate.sh
```

**Success!** Node drain now allowed.

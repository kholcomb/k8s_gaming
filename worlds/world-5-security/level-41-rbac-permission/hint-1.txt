🔍 HINT 1: Observing the Problem

Let's investigate the RBAC permission issue:

1️⃣ Check pod status and logs:
   kubectl get pod pod-lister -n k8squest
   kubectl logs pod-lister -n k8squest
   
   What error do you see? "Forbidden"?

2️⃣ Check ServiceAccount:
   kubectl get serviceaccount pod-reader -n k8squest
   
   ServiceAccount exists, but does it have permissions?

3️⃣ Check for Role:
   kubectl get role -n k8squest
   
   Is there a Role defined?

4️⃣ Check for RoleBinding:
   kubectl get rolebinding -n k8squest
   
   Is there a RoleBinding connecting ServiceAccount to Role?

5️⃣ Test permissions directly:
   kubectl auth can-i list pods --as=system:serviceaccount:k8squest:pod-reader -n k8squest
   
   Does it say "no"?

📝 Key Observation:
The ServiceAccount exists but has NO RBAC permissions! Missing Role and RoleBinding.

🤔 Questions:
• What is RBAC?
• What's the difference between Role and RoleBinding?
• How do you grant permissions to a ServiceAccount?

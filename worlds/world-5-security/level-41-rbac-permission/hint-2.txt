🎯 HINT 2: Understanding RBAC

The problem is missing Role and RoleBinding!

📚 RBAC Components:

**1. ServiceAccount (WHO)**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: pod-reader  # The "user"
```

**2. Role (WHAT permissions)**
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: pod-reader-role
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]  # Core API
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]  # What actions allowed
```

**3. RoleBinding (WHO gets WHAT)**
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: pod-reader-binding
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader-role  # The WHAT
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: pod-reader  # The WHO
```

🔍 How It Works:

1. ServiceAccount = Identity (who the pod runs as)
2. Role = Permission definition (what can be done)
3. RoleBinding = Grants Role to ServiceAccount

**Current State:**
- ✅ ServiceAccount exists
- ❌ No Role (no permissions defined)
- ❌ No RoleBinding (ServiceAccount not granted anything)

**Result:** Permission denied!

💡 The Solution:
Create Role with pod list permissions, then create RoleBinding to grant it to the ServiceAccount!

🔍 OBSERVATION HINT

What to Look For:
==================

Users are randomly getting logged out of your application. They successfully log in, 
but their next request shows them as not authenticated. This is a classic sign of 
session management issues in a distributed system.

Check These Areas:
------------------

1. **Client Logs**
   Check what responses the client is getting:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs client -n k8squest
   ```

   Look for:
   • Are responses coming from different pods?
   • "Session Pod 1", "Session Pod 2", "Session Pod 3" alternating?

2. **Service Configuration**
   View the Service:
   ```bash
   kubectl describe service session-service -n k8squest
   ```

   Look for:
   • Session Affinity: None (or missing)
   • This means load-balancing is RANDOM

3. **The Problem**
   ```
   Request 1: User logs in → Goes to Pod 1 → Session stored in Pod 1
   Request 2: User accesses page → Goes to Pod 2 → No session! Logged out!
   Request 3: User tries again → Goes to Pod 3 → No session! Still logged out!
   Request 4: User tries again → Goes to Pod 1 → Session found! Logged in!
   ```

🎯 Key Questions:
-----------------

• How does the Service decide which pod to send each request to?
• What happens to session data when a request goes to a different pod?
• Is there a way to ensure the same client always goes to the same pod?

💭 Think About:
---------------

Imagine you're at a restaurant with 3 cashiers. You order from Cashier 1, but when 
you come back to pick up your food, you're randomly assigned to Cashier 2. Cashier 2 
has no record of your order!

Solution? Make sure you always go back to the SAME cashier (sticky sessions).

In Kubernetes, this is called "session affinity" or "sticky sessions."

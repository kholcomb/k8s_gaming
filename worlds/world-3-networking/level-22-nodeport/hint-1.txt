🔍 Observation Hint:

Check the service details: `kubectl get svc web-nodeport -n k8squest`

You'll see a NodePort assigned (random port in 30000-32767 range).

The problem? It's random! You need to specify an explicit NodePort for predictable access.

Look at the service YAML - is nodePort specified in the ports section?

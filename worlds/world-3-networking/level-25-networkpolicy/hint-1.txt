🔍 OBSERVATION HINT

What to Look For:
==================

Your frontend pod is trying to connect to the backend, but it's failing with 
connection timeout errors. The backend pod is healthy and the service exists, 
so why can't the frontend reach it?

Check These Areas:
------------------

1. **Frontend Pod Logs**
   Check what errors the frontend is seeing:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs frontend -n k8squest
   ```

   Look for:
   • "Connection refused"
   • "Connection timed out"
   • "Network is unreachable"

2. **NetworkPolicy Configuration**
   View the NetworkPolicy:
   ```bash
   kubectl describe networkpolicy backend-network-policy -n k8squest
   ```

   Look at:
   • Which pods does it apply to? (PodSelector)
   • What traffic does it allow? (Ingress rules)
   • What labels are required for access?

3. **Frontend Pod Labels**
   Check the frontend pod's labels:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pod frontend -n k8squest --show-labels
   ```

   What labels does the frontend have?

4. **Label Matching**
   Compare:
   • NetworkPolicy allows traffic from pods with label: `app: ???`
   • Frontend pod has label: `app: ???`
   • Do they match?

🎯 Key Questions:
-----------------

• What label selector does the NetworkPolicy use to allow traffic?
• What labels does the frontend pod actually have?
• Is there a mismatch?

💭 Think About:
---------------

NetworkPolicies are like bouncers at a club - they check your "label badge" 
before letting you in. If your badge (label) doesn't match what the bouncer 
(NetworkPolicy) is looking for, you don't get in!

In this case:
- The NetworkPolicy bouncer is looking for a specific label
- The frontend pod has a different label
- Result: Connection denied!

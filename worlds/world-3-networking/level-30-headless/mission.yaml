title: "StatefulSet DNS Not Working"
difficulty: intermediate
xp_reward: 250
estimated_time: "20 minutes"

description: |
  Your StatefulSet pods can't communicate with each other using predictable DNS names. 
  The application expects to reach individual pods at pod-0.service-name, pod-1.service-name, 
  but DNS resolution isn't working. The service is configured with a ClusterIP, but 
  StatefulSets require a special type of service called a "headless service" for direct 
  pod-to-pod DNS resolution.

learning_objectives:
  - Understand headless services (clusterIP: None)
  - Learn StatefulSet DNS naming conventions
  - Configure services for StatefulSet communication
  - Understand when to use headless vs ClusterIP services

concepts:
  - headless-service
  - statefulset-dns
  - pod-identity
  - stable-network-identity
  - clusterip-none

success_criteria:
  - Each StatefulSet pod accessible via predictable DNS name
  - DNS format: <pod-name>.<service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local
  - Service configured as headless (clusterIP: None)

🔍 OBSERVATION HINT

What to Look For:
==================

Your service exists and pods are running, but you're seeing intermittent errors when 
pods restart. Sometimes requests work, sometimes they fail with connection errors.

Check These Areas:
------------------

1. **Service Endpoints**
   Check what endpoints the service has:
   ```bash
   kubectl get endpoints web-service -n k8squest
   ```

   Do you see pod IPs listed?

2. **Pod Status**
   Check pod readiness:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n k8squest -l app=web
   ```

   Look at the READY column:
   • 1/1 = Ready
   • 0/1 = Not ready

3. **Pod Events**
   Check pod events:
   ```bash
   kubectl describe pod web-app-1 -n k8squest
   ```

   Look for:
   • "Readiness probe failed"
   • "Readiness probe succeeded"
   • Or... NO readiness probe messages at all?

4. **The Problem**
   If you see NO readiness probe messages, that's the issue! Without a readiness 
   probe, Kubernetes doesn't know when pods are actually ready.

🎯 Key Questions:
-----------------

• When a pod starts, how does Kubernetes know it's ready to serve traffic?
• What happens if traffic is sent to a pod that's still initializing?
• How do pods get added to service endpoints?

💭 Think About:
---------------

Imagine ordering food delivery:

- **Without readiness check:** Driver delivers immediately after restaurant accepts order
  - Result: You get your food before it's cooked! ❌

- **With readiness check:** Driver waits until food is actually ready
  - Result: You get hot, properly prepared food ✅

Similarly, without a readiness probe, Kubernetes sends traffic to pods immediately 
when they start, even if the application inside isn't ready yet!

🧭 DIRECTION HINT

The Problem Identified:
========================

Your Ingress is configured with the WRONG PATH. This is a classic path mismatch issue.

Current Situation:
------------------

```yaml
# In broken.yaml
spec:
  rules:
  - host: myapp.local
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /api        # ❌ WRONG!
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: web-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

What's Happening:
-----------------

1. **Your Request:**
   - You access: http://myapp.local/
   - Path requested: "/"

2. **Ingress Configuration:**
   - Ingress looks for: "/api"
   - Does "/" match "/api"? NO!

3. **Result:**
   - Request doesn't match any Ingress rule
   - Returns: 404 Not Found

The Fix:
--------

The application (nginx) serves content at the ROOT path ("/"), not at "/api".

You need to change the Ingress path from "/api" to "/" so it matches the actual 
requests being made.

Path Types Explained:
---------------------

• **Prefix**: Matches /path and /path/anything
  - "/api" matches: /api, /api/users, /api/v1/posts
  - "/api" does NOT match: /, /home, /app

• **Exact**: Matches ONLY the exact path
  - "/api" matches: /api only
  - "/api" does NOT match: /api/users, /api/

For this level, you want to match ALL requests to myapp.local, so use:
- path: /
- pathType: Prefix

This will match /, /index.html, /css/style.css, etc.

What to Do:
-----------

Edit broken.yaml and change the path from "/api" to "/", then reapply:

```bash
# After editing
kubectl apply -f broken.yaml
kubectl get ingress web-ingress -n k8squest
```

🔍 OBSERVATION HINT

What to Look For:
==================

You're getting 404 errors when trying to access http://myapp.local, but the Ingress 
and Service both exist. The issue is in HOW the Ingress is routing traffic.

Check These Areas:
------------------

1. **Ingress Configuration**
   View your Ingress:
   ```bash
   kubectl describe ingress web-ingress -n k8squest
   ```

   Look at the "Rules" section. What path is configured?

2. **Path Matching**
   The Ingress has a path configured, but is it the RIGHT path?
   
   Questions to ask:
   • What path is your Ingress looking for?
   • What path are you trying to access?
   • Do they match?

3. **Service Endpoints**
   Check if the Service has endpoints:
   ```bash
   kubectl get endpoints web-service -n k8squest
   ```

🎯 Key Questions:
-----------------

• When you access http://myapp.local, what path are you actually requesting?
• What path did you configure in the Ingress?
• Does the path in broken.yaml match the path you're requesting?

💭 Think About:
---------------

If your application serves content at the root ("/"), but your Ingress is 
configured to route "/api", what happens when someone accesses "/"?

Hint: The request never matches the Ingress rule, so you get 404!

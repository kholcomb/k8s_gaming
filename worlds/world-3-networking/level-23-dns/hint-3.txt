✅ Solution Hint:

Fix the client pod to use correct service name:

```bash
kubectl delete pod app-client -n k8squest
kubectl apply -f solution.yaml -n k8squest
```

Or edit broken.yaml and change:
```yaml
args:
- |
  pg_isready -h database -p 5432  # Wrong
```

To:
```yaml
args:
- |
  pg_isready -h database-service -p 5432  # Correct!
```

Then recreate the pod. Check logs to verify connection success:
```bash
kubectl logs app-client -n k8squest
```

🧭 Direction Hint:

Kubernetes DNS creates records for services in format:
`<service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local`

Within same namespace, you can use short name: `<service-name>`

The client is using "database" but service is "database-service".

You need to fix the client pod to use the correct service name!

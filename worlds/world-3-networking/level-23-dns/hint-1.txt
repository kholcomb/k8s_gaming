🔍 Observation Hint:

Check the client pod logs: `kubectl logs app-client -n k8squest`

You'll see "Connection failed" repeating. The pod is trying to connect to hostname "database".

But what's the actual SERVICE name? `kubectl get svc -n k8squest`

The service is named "database-service", not "database"!

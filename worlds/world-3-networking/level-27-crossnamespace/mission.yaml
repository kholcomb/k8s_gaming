description: |
  A frontend application in the 'k8squest' namespace needs to call an API in the 
  'backend-ns' namespace, but it can't connect. The issue is using a short service 
  name instead of the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN). You need to fix the DNS 
  name to enable cross-namespace communication.

concepts:
  - Cross-namespace service communication
  - Kubernetes DNS FQDN format
  - Service discovery across namespaces
  - DNS resolution in Kubernetes

learning_objectives:
  - Understand Kubernetes DNS naming conventions
  - Use FQDN for cross-namespace service access
  - Learn when short names work vs when FQDNs are required
  - Debug DNS resolution issues across namespaces

scenario: |
  Your company uses namespace isolation—frontend apps in one namespace, backend 
  services in another. The frontend needs to call the backend API, but it's using 
  the short service name which only works within the same namespace.

success_criteria:
  - Frontend can successfully connect to backend service
  - Using proper FQDN format: service.namespace.svc.cluster.local
  - DNS resolution works across namespaces
  - Connection succeeds and returns API response

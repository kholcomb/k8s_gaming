🔍 OBSERVATION HINT

What to Look For:
==================

Your frontend application is trying to call an API service, but it can't connect. 
The error message says the host cannot be resolved—a classic DNS issue.

Check These Areas:
------------------

1. **Frontend Pod Logs**
   Check what error the frontend is seeing:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs frontend-app -n k8squest
   ```

   Look for:
   • "could not resolve host"
   • "bad address"
   • "name or service not known"

2. **Namespaces**
   Check which namespaces exist:
   ```bash
   kubectl get namespaces
   ```

   Where is the frontend pod?
   ```bash
   kubectl get pod frontend-app -o wide
   ```

   Where is the backend service?
   ```bash
   kubectl get service --all-namespaces
   ```

3. **Service Names**
   What service name is the frontend trying to access?
   ```bash
   kubectl get pod frontend-app -n k8squest -o yaml | grep command -A5
   ```

   Does that service exist in the k8squest namespace?
   ```bash
   kubectl get service api-service -n k8squest
   ```

   What about in other namespaces?
   ```bash
   kubectl get service api-service -n backend-ns
   ```

🎯 Key Questions:
-----------------

• What namespace is the frontend pod in?
• What namespace is the backend service in?
• Are they in the SAME namespace or DIFFERENT namespaces?
• What DNS name is the frontend using to reach the backend?

💭 Think About:
---------------

Kubernetes DNS works like your phone's contacts:

- **Short name** (like "John"): Only works if John is in your current group
- **Full name** (like "John from Marketing"): Works across different departments

Similarly:
- **Short service name** ("api-service"): Only works within same namespace
- **Qualified name** ("api-service.backend-ns"): Works across namespaces

The frontend is trying to call "api-service" but it's in a different namespace!

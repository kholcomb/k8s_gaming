description: |
  Your team deployed a service with type LoadBalancer, but it's been stuck in "Pending" 
  state for 10 minutes. External clients can't access the application. The service works 
  fine in the cloud environment, but your local development cluster can't provision the 
  LoadBalancer. You need to understand the difference between service types and choose 
  the right one for local development.

learning_objectives:
  - Understand Kubernetes service types (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer)
  - Learn why LoadBalancer services need cloud provider integration
  - Configure NodePort services for local cluster access
  - Understand the limitations of different service types

concepts:
  - service-types
  - loadbalancer
  - nodeport
  - cloud-provider-integration
  - local-cluster-limitations

success_criteria:
  - Service is accessible from outside the cluster
  - Service no longer stuck in Pending state
  - Correct service type for local development

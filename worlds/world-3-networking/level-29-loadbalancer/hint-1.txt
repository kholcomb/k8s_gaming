🔍 HINT 1: Observing the Problem

Let's investigate why the service isn't accessible:

1️⃣ Check the service status:
   kubectl get service web-service -n k8squest
   
   Notice the EXTERNAL-IP column - what do you see?

2️⃣ Look for more details:
   kubectl describe service web-service -n k8squest
   
   Pay attention to:
   • Type: LoadBalancer
   • LoadBalancer Ingress: <pending>
   • What does "pending" mean?

3️⃣ Check the service type:
   kubectl get service web-service -n k8squest -o yaml | grep type:
   
   What type of service is this?

4️⃣ Think about your environment:
   • Are you running in a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure)?
   • Or are you in a local cluster (kind, minikube, k3d)?
   • What's the difference?

📝 Key Observation:
   LoadBalancer services need external load balancer provisioning from cloud providers.
   In local clusters, they stay in "Pending" state forever because there's no cloud 
   provider to create the load balancer.

🤔 Questions to Consider:
   • What service type works in local clusters?
   • How can you expose a service externally without cloud provider integration?
   • What are the different Kubernetes service types?

Keep investigating! The service type is the key to solving this issue.

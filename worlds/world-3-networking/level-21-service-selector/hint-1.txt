🔍 Observation Hint:

Check the service details: `kubectl describe svc backend-service -n k8squest`

Look at the "Endpoints" field. Is it empty? That means no pods match the service selector!

Now check the pod labels: `kubectl get pod backend-pod -n k8squest --show-labels`

Compare the pod's labels with the service's selector.

🧭 Direction Hint:

The problem is with the service selector!

The service is looking for pods with label `app: backend-app`, but the pod has `app: backend`.

You need to either:
1. Change the service selector to match the pod labels, OR
2. Change the pod labels to match the service selector

Option 1 is easier - just edit the service!
